## Output Requirements

You MUST end your response with a fenced JSON code block containing your structured output.

**CRITICAL:** Use exactly this format with triple backticks and "json" label:

```json
{ "status": "...", ... }
```

The JSON MUST be in a fenced code block (triple backticks with json label).
Bare JSON without fences will NOT be accepted.
